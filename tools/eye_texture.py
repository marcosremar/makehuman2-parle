    Paints the eye map of the low-poly eye for the Parle cast, in the style of the two characters
    the owner likes (Rafa and the player): a light warm iris against a black pupil of about half
    its width, a thin dark ring and fine radial fibres. The stock map has a dark muddy iris, so at
    game distance pupil and iris merge and the eye reads as a hole. Same UV layout as stock: one
    iris per eye. The highlight comes from the renderer, like theirs.
